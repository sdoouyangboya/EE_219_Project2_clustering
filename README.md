#  UCLA_EE_219_Project2_clustering

## Project Goals
1.Find proper representations of the data.
2.Perform K-means, DBCAN and HDBSAN clustering on the dataset, and evaluate the result of the clustering.
3.Experiment differenct preprocessng methods (truncated SVD, NMF) to increase the performance of the clustering.

In order to define the clustering task, we pretent hte class label are not available and aim to find the groupings of the documents. Then the class labels are used as ground truth to evaluate the performance of the clustering task.

## Data Preparation Plan

we analyzed "20 Newsgroups" dataset, which is a collection of approximately 2000 documents,partitioned evenly across 20 differeent news groups, each corresponding to a different topic.
